## 💡 Motivation

- **Can we remove vision encoder from VLMs?**

- **How to transfer an LLM to an encoder-free VLM efficiently and stably?**
  
- **How to bridge the performance gap between encoder-free and encoder-based VLMs?** 

## 📜 News

[2024/09/26] Our **EVE** has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2024** (**spotlight**) ! 💥       
[2024/06/18] The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11832), [weights](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/EVE-7B-HD-v1.0), and [code](https://github.com/baaivision/EVE/EVEv1/README.md) of **EVE** are released ! 💥   

## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 **Superior Capability:** *An originated encoder-free* LVLM with *arbitrary* image aspect ratio, outperforming the counterparts and approaching existing *modular encoder-based* LVLMs.  

- 🔥 **Data Efficiency:** Filter and recaption solely *<100M* publicly avaliable data from OpenImages, SAM, LAION, Datacomp for pre-training.  

- 🔥 **Pioneering Route:** We attempt to provide an *efficient*, *transparent*, and *practical* training strategy and procedure for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities.
